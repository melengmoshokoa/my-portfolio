- Personal Information: Displays my name (Itumeleng J. MOSHOKOA) and a brief introduction message (Hi welcome to my portfolio). There's also a tagline describing my skills (Software Engineer | Data Science | UI/UX Design).
- Interactive Buttons: Several buttons for contacting me, including "Contact me," "Email," "LinkedIn," and "Github."
- Typography: Uses custom fonts like Bebas Neue, Bodoni Moda, and Montserrat to style headings and text.
